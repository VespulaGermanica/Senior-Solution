# Senior Solution
Building AI course project

## Summary
A complex solution to the problem of increasing number of senior citizens and the decreasing number of quality care-takers, loneliness in old age, and a widening gap between  generations due to the ever-faster pace of technological development and more frequent societal changes. It would allow communication between like-minded seniors through screen and afterwards face-to-face if possible, recommend content from their days they even forgot they knew and help with mechanical tasks through the use of joint supporters, gyroscope-spoons for parkinsons disease etc. 


## Background
* There is a growing number of senior citizens, and not only in the Western society. For example, China has this problem as well (because of the one child policy in the past). In the last century the world has become one global playground and it is not uncommon that children move to a different country or place, sometimes for comfort, sometimes only to earn a little more and support their own family - leaving their parents to age unattended, alone, surrounded only by 4 walls (and a cat). 
* Another contributing factor is the growing generation gap caused by technological disruption - As the new digital generation stares into their screens, using their "meme language" and finding value in a dog-face filter, the grandmas have more problems to come up with topics to talk about or to even understand the young person. Therefore they feel alienated, left alone and useless which also speeds-up the rise of mental disease
* Although the average affluent citizen may be able to afford a quality seniors home, from personal experience I know that is not the case. My mother is a caretaker and she worked in a few of the "Not-the-1st-Class"- casual senior homes, and some stories she told me include the following: "The caretakers were yelling at the old, immobile people to eat faster, they shouted at them when they urinated themselves, when they could not stand up right away, they humiliated them by leaving them sitting on a full toilet device for hours" etc. just to name a few. Yep, that is the reality of some folks (to note, the caretakers earn maybe 200e more than the minimum wage, so no wonder - but this is rather a societal problem).
* I think this topic is not interesting, but crucial - there is no reason why life should end in unnecessary suffering when it can be prevented. Unfortunately, even when you google some articles on the topic of senior care FROM GODDAMN 1st WORLD GERMANY, you will see that we do not have this solved AT ALL.


## How is it used?
* The main idea is to be able to connect seniors with somebody they can talk to and who will understand them. You put in their ideas, opinions (which may sound easier than it is) interests, music and movie taste and according to these parameters they could be connected with likeminded people via screen, and if their physical state allows it, they could afterwards even meet face-to-face. Whether another person or an AI therapist (link in sources), it would make their time much less lonely. It would also be possible to "request a walk, grocery shopping or another need" and connected to for ex. some social service which would react to this request by sending someone to take the person out, smell the flowers, have a chat and provide for their shopping needs.
* The second part focuses on the tasks which they cannot handle themselves anymore - motion support, whether a exoskeleton (link in sources - Exoskeleton) on joints which supports the body so that it can at least to some extent help with locomotion, or custom solutions to diagnoses such as parkinson, for which there is already a gyroscope-spoon developed so that even with a shaking hand they can eat with dignity (link in sources - Parkinson Spoon). This could also include the reminders of taking medication, which for example people with Alzheimers often forget. But unfortunately, the motion support is definitely limited to people who still can walk and are not already completely immobile.
* The third part is focused on content recommendation - from my own experience, the time spent behind behind screens is enormous and the time spent reading TV programm is also high. With some clues about their personal taste, the system would be able to find just the right led zeppelin song that they loved when they were 16 and in love for the first time.
* The last idea I had was to include fire and gas sensors - you probably heard stories about an old lady who blew up a whole block by forgetting that she put the stove on. In this case if there was such a situation, the local police or fire station could be alarmed and such an incident could be prevented.


## Data sources and AI methods
* Since the core idea revolves around communication and psychology, I will not try and suggest how to programm an AI therapist. This already exists and I put a link under this section. There might also be a need to fill in the diagnoses and behavioral patterns of seniors. 
* It could also make use of a recommendation algorithm - if they liked one show from the 60s,  there are many more of a similar quality and taste. 
* Among other things the system would also need a whole set of movement sensors and sensor sets for scanning the environment when moving around - basicly like a self-driving car.

## Challenges
What I consider to be the biggest challenge (except for the enormous amount of work it would take to get all segments of the idea right) is to introduce the technology successfully. Most of us have probably encountered the stubbornness of older folks and to tell grandpa that "we bought you a robot" without seeing it flying out of the window as you leave the place  might be quite complicated. Also, many people will not satisfy with a screen and they prefer a human touch, which could be added to the whole circus, supposing we find enough people willing to commit.

## What next?
A psychologist, a lawyer, and a galaxy of patience
